【啟應讀經/Responsive Reading】以弗所書/Ephesians 4:1-16

(Lead)As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. 2 Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. 3 Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. 4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; 
(啟)我為主被囚的勸你們：既然蒙召，行事為人就當與蒙召的恩相稱。 凡事謙虛、溫柔、忍耐，用愛心互相寬容，用和平彼此聯絡，竭力保守聖靈所賜合而為一的心，身體只有一個，聖靈只有一個，正如你們蒙召同有一個指望。 
(Resp)5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.7 But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. 8 This is why it[a] says:“When he ascended on high,he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.”[b]
(應)一主，一信，一洗， 一神，就是眾人的父，超乎眾人之上，貫乎眾人之中，也住在眾人之內。我們各人蒙恩，都是照基督所量給各人的恩賜。所以經上說：他升上高天的時候，擄掠了仇敵，將各樣的恩賜賞給人。 
(Lead) What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions? 10 He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe. 11 So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 12 to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 
(啟) 既說升上，豈不是先降在地下嗎？那降下的，就是遠升諸天之上要充滿萬有的。他所賜的，有使徒，有先知，有傳福音的，有牧師和教師， 為要成全聖徒，各盡其職，建立基督的身體， 
(Resp) until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.14 Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. 15 Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. 16 From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.
(應) 直等到我們眾人在真道上同歸於一，認識神的兒子，得以長大成人，滿有基督長成的身量，使我們不再作小孩子，中了人的詭計和欺騙的法術，被一切異教之風搖動，飄來飄去，就隨從各樣的異端； 惟用愛心說誠實話，凡事長進，連於元首基督，全身都靠他聯絡得合式，百節各按各職，照著各體的功用彼此相助，便叫身體漸漸增長，在愛中建立自己
