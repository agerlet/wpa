【Responsive Reading啟應讀經】Romans羅馬書 15:4-13

(Lead) For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope.
（領）從前所寫的聖經，都是為教訓我們寫的，叫我們因聖經所生的忍耐和安慰，可以得著盼望。
 
(Congregation) May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give us the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had, so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
(眾)但願賜忍耐安慰的神，叫我們彼此同心，效法基督耶穌，一心一口榮耀神我們主耶穌基督的父! 

(Lead) Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God. 8 For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of God’s truth, so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed    
(領)所以，你們要彼此接納，如同基督接納你們一樣，使榮耀歸與神。我說，基督是為神真理作了受割禮人的執事，要證實所應許列祖的話， 
 
(Congregation)  and, moreover, that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written:“Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing the praises of your name.”[
(眾)並叫外邦人因他的憐憫榮耀神。如經上所記:“因此，我要在外邦中稱讚你，歌頌你的名;”

(Lead)Again, it says,“Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.”And again,“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles;let all the peoples extol him.”And again, Isaiah says,“The Root of Jesse will spring up,one who will arise to rule over the nations;in him the Gentiles will hope.” 
(領)又說:“列邦啊，當與主的百姓一同歡樂;“ 又說:”萬國啊，你們當讚美主!願萬民都頌讚他!”又有以賽亞說:“將來有耶西的根，就是那興起來要治理外邦的; 列邦都寄望於他。”

(Congregation) May the God of hope fill us with all joy and peace as we trust in him, so that we may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
(眾)但願使人有盼望的神，因信將諸般的喜樂、平安，充滿我們的心， 
使我們藉著聖靈的能力，大有盼望。

【Scripture證道經文】Luke路加福音3:1-16
1 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene。
1凱撒提庇留執政第十五年，本丟·彼拉多任猶太總督，希律做加利利的分封王，他的弟弟腓力做以土利亞和特拉可尼兩地的分封王，呂撒聶做亞比利尼的分封王，  

2 during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
2 亞那和該亞法當大祭司。當時，撒迦利亞的兒子約翰住在曠野，上帝向他說話。

3 He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 
3 他就到約旦河附近宣講悔改的洗禮，使人的罪得到赦免。

4 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet:“A voice of one calling in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way for the Lord,make straight paths for him.
4 這正應驗了以賽亞先知書上的話：“在曠野有人大聲呼喊，預備主的道，修直祂的路。”

5 ‘Every valley shall be filled in,every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight,the rough ways smooth.
5“一切山谷將被填滿，大山小丘將被削平，彎曲的道路要被修直，崎嶇的路徑要被鋪平。

6 And all people will see God’s salvation.’
6 世人都要看見上帝的救恩。”

7 John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers!Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
7 約翰對前來接受他洗禮的人群說：“你們這些毒蛇的後代！誰指示你們逃避那將臨的烈怒呢？ ”

8 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 
8 你們要結出與悔改相稱的果子。不要心裡說，“我們是亞伯拉罕的子孫。”我告訴你們，上帝可以從這些石頭中興起亞伯拉罕的子孫。 

9 The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”
9 現在斧頭已經放在樹根上了，不結好果子的樹都要被砍下丟在火裡。

10 “What should we do then?” the crowd asked.
10 眾人問道：“那麼，我們該怎麼辦呢？”

11 John answered, “Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.” 
11 約翰回答說：“有兩件衣服的，應當分一件給沒有的；食物充裕的，應當分些給饑餓的。”

12 Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?” 
12 有些稅吏也來受洗，並問約翰：“老師，我們該怎麼辦呢？”

13 “Don’t collect any more than you are required to,” he told them.
13 約翰說：“除了規定的稅以外，一分錢也不可多收。”

14 Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?” He replied, “Don’t extort money and don’t accuse people falsely—be content with your pay.”
14 有些軍人問：“我們該怎麼辦呢？”約翰說：“不可敲詐勒索，自己有糧餉就當知足。”

15 The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. 
15 當時的百姓正期待著基督的來臨，大家心裡都在猜想，也許約翰就是基督。

16 John answered them all, “I baptize you with water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
 16 約翰對眾人說：“我是用水給你們施洗，但有一位能力比我更大的快來了，我就是給祂解鞋帶也不配。祂要用聖靈和火給你們施洗。”

【Responding Song回應詩歌】O Boundless Salvation《美哉無窮救恩》

1. O BOUNDLESS salvation! deep ocean of love,
O fulness of mercy, Christ brought from above,
1. 美哉無窮救恩，如大海深淵，
奇哉豐富慈愛，救主帶自天；

The whole world redeeming, so rich and so free,
Now flowing for all men, Now flowing for all men ,
Now flowing for all men come, roll over me!
普救天下罪人，廣沾神厚恩，
既已福蔭萬民，既已福蔭萬民，
既已福蔭萬民，求惠臨我身！ 

2. My sins they are many, their stains are so deep,
And bitter the tears of remorse that I weep;
2. 我的罪惡甚多，孽海十分深，
痛悔哭泣呼喊，其苦如刺心；

But useless is weeping; thou great crimson sea,
Thy waters can cleanse me, Thy waters can cleanse me 
Thy waters can cleanse me come, roll over me!
哭泣皆是無用，惟求主憐憫，
主血能洗我心，主血能洗我心，
主血能洗我心，求惠臨我身！ 


And now, hallelujah! the rest of my days
Shall gladly be spent in promoting his praise
齊唱哈利路亞! 我天天頌唱 
頌讚我的救主，祂美好救恩! 

Who opened his bosom to pour out this sea
Of boundless salvation, Of boundless salvation 
Of boundless salvation , for you and for me.
主打開拯救門， 主降世捨命 
美哉無窮救恩，美哉無窮救恩， 
美哉無窮救恩， 為了你和我。
